# M-Duty
A script made by me, when you do /emsduty it adds a blip colour and a blip for other leos/ ems, when you do /duty it sends you on duty as an LEO, I will be later along the line adding a hud and a function to spawn LEO's in with weapons!

ace perms go as followed: 

furiousfoxgg.duty --for the /duty command (lets you go on duty as LEO)

furiousfoxgg.emsduty.toggle --for the /emsduty command (lets you go on/ off duty as EMS)

furiousfoxgg.civ.toggle --lets you go on as a civillian, more will be added to this soon as this doesn't really do much as of now

Commands:
/duty --sends you on duty as LEO, if you do it again then it will send you off duty, also adds a fancy blip so you can see other LEO's and EMS on the map

/emsduty --sends you on duty as EMS, if you do this again it will send you off duty, also adds a fancy blip so you can see other LEO's and EMS on the map

/civ --sends you onduty as a civ, if used again will send  you off duty (pretty useless)
